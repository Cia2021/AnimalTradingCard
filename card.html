			<p class="fav-fact">Wolves are complex, highly intelligent animals who are caring, playful, 
    and above all devoted to family. Only a select few other species exhibit these traits so clearly.
    Just like elephants, gorillas and dolphins, wolves educate their young, take care of their injured 
    and live in family groups.</p>
